### About me
I am an independent software engineer based in **London, UK**. I have been working with Python and Django since early 2010.

### My professional experience
My first foray into professional software development was in the middle of 2008, where I worked for [Lead Galaxy](http://www.leadgalaxy.com/) writing **PHP** scripts. Shortly thereafter I was involved in creating **Drupal**-based websites for [Ediciones Puma](http://www.edicionespuma.org/) and [Certeza Unida](http://www.certezaunida.com/) (both sites are in Spanish). In early 2009 I was approached by [UNELA University](http://www.unela.ac.cr/) and asked to build them a simple library-cataloguing system in **PHP**/**MySQL**, which later became the [Biblio Project](http://biblio.kazbak.co.uk/).

On my return to the UK in late 2009, I decided that **Python** development was the way forward and subsequently found a job working for [Cmed Technology](http://www.cmedtechnology.com/) developing eClinical solutions using **Python**, **Django**, **GTK** and **PostgreSQL** on an **Ubuntu**/**Apache** setup. A few years later I began working for [Axicorda](http://www.axicorda.com/), where I was able to hone my **Django** and **Javascript**/**JQuery**/**AJAX** skills, working (amongst other things) on data analysis in the financial services industry.

After a little bit of soul-searching, I decided that Axicorda was not the place for me, so I began looking for work as a self-employed contractor. I quickly came upon a start-up named [Eco Market](http://www.ecomarket.com/) who were in need of a developer. For much of my time here I was the sole developer, and learned a lot about working with startups and the technologies used in the e-commerce sphere (such as **Solr**), as well as the ins and outs of server configuration using **Nginx** and **Gunicorn**. I worked with them for around nine months before moving on to [Potato](http://www.potatolondon.com/), working on complex web applications for the likes of [Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/). Here I learned all about **Google App Engine**, and honed my front-end skills by learning how to use technologies such as **Knockout.js**, **Google Closure** and **Grunt**.
